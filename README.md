# mvvvm-starter-project

MVVM starter project which can be used to save effort in the begging of any project

## Design Pattern
MVVV design pattern as recomended in docs [guide to app archticture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) , with some modification to the network layer adding Kotlin couritines, also using dagger for dependency injection 

## Technology used

* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) for asynchronous programming
* [dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) for dependency injection
* [databinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) to bind data to ui
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/) to handle navigation between screens
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to bind data to ui
* [Retrofit] for networking
* [timper for] logging
* [customLogger] for logging formatting
